        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Delicacy made with two very simple ingredients: Doritos and Mountain Dew</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>A bag of doritos</li>
            <li>A bottle of Mountain Dew</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Crash the doritos while still in the bag, using a heavy object, like a shoe, or the moon.</li>
            <li>Take a bowl and pure in the Mountain Dew until it's full. Drink the rest.</li>
            <li>Pure the broken doritos in the bowl. Be careful not to overdo it as we want a soupy consistency, not a sludge (you're not an animal).</li>
            <li>Enjoy as lunch, second breakfast or late dinner!</li>
        </ol>
